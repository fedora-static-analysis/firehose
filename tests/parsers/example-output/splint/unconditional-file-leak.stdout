examples/unconditional-file-leak.c: (in function test)
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:7:7:
    Called procedure fopen may access file system state, but globals list does
    not include globals fileSystem
  A called function uses internal state, but the globals list for the function
  being checked does not include internalState (Use -internalglobs to inhibit
  warning)
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:7:7:
    Undocumented modification of file system state possible from call to fopen:
    fopen(filename, "w")
  report undocumented file system modifications (applies to unspecified
  functions if modnomods is set) (Use -modfilesys to inhibit warning)
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:9:5:
    Called procedure fprintf may access file system state, but globals list
    does not include globals fileSystem
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:9:5:
    Undocumented modification of file system state possible from call to
    fprintf: fprintf(f, "%i: %i", i, i * i)
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:9:14:
    Possibly null storage f passed as non-null param: fprintf (f, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:7:7: Storage f may become null
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:9:5: Body of for statement is not a block:
                                           fprintf(f, "%i: %i", i, i * i);
  Loop body is a single statement, not a compound block. (Use -forblock to
  inhibit warning)
examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:3:6: Function test declared but not used
  A function is declared but not used. Use /*@unused@*/ in front of function
  header to suppress message. (Use -fcnuse to inhibit warning)

examples/unconditional-file-leak.c:3:6:
    Function test exported but not declared in header file
  A declaration is exported, but does not appear in a header file. (Use
  -exportheader to inhibit warning)
